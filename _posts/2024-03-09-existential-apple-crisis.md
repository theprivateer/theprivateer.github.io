title: "Existential Apple Crisis"
---
At the start of the year I started to write a blog post about how I was growing increasingly uncomfortable with being ‘all-in’ with Apple products and services. It was intended to be an in-depth look at all the the products and services I use, and how and why I was starting to get dissatisfied with them (after years of almost evangelical use), but I ran out of steam.

Whilst there is no denying that Apple’s products and services are well designed and put together, they are no longer the silver bullet for my needs. Paired with the fact that Apple are no longer the type of company that I want to exclusively hitch my wagon to, it’s time to make a change.

This is not to say I’m not a fan of my iPhone (I even recently upgraded from my 13 Mini to a 15 Pro), or that I’m going to leave my MacBook Pro to gather dust, but I want to have the option of switching to a different platform without having to leave behind everything that I’ve grown to rely on.

This means finding cross-platform options for many of the embedded apps, products and services in the Apple eco-system.

I have already started. One of the reasons I didn't finish writing my original blog post was that I got tired of writing about and justifying my intentions, and just got on with doing it. If you take a look at the [stuff I use](/uses) you’ll start to see more non-Apple products appearing and replacing the incumbent Apple equivalents.

I’d like to write more about this process - not to hate on Apple, but to illustrate what is possible. I think if I’m more focused - one app, service or product at time - I’ll be able to do it.
