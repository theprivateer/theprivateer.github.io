Now that I'm back from my trip to the UK and am (mostly) recovered from the jetlag / generally feeling under-the-weather it's time to start focussing on this site.

It's a two-pronged approach - content and appearance. While on holiday I've been furiously noting down ideas for posts that I want to write and features / sections I want to add - now I need to carve out some time to actually write them!

Also, the site is still running a slightly modified version of the bog-standard Minima theme that ships with Jekyll, and I'm not happy about that. Whilst it is suitably minimal (which I like), I'm not a fan of the typography, spacing and, well, everything. For now I might just try and retrofit the theme from when this was a Jigsaw site - we'll see.
