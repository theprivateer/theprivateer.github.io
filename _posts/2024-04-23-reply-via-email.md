This site does not have comments enabled - and likely never will. It's a lot of overhead to manage and maintain, and would require a fundamental change to how I host my site (goodbye fast static-site generators, hello databases). I simply don't want to use a hosted service such as Disqus where the content lives outside of the context of my site.

Instead I'm opting for the OG method of direct messaging - email. If you want to respond to any of my posts, [send me an email](mailto:phils@hey.com). To make things easier all of my blog posts now have a 'Reply via email' link at the bottom. I look forward to hearing from you.
