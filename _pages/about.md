I'm a cyclist and software developer.

I live in Brisbane, Australia with my wife and two kids and I spend way too much time looking at bikes on the internet.

The best way to reach me is by email at [phils@hey.com](mailto:phils@hey.com).

I check email once a day in the evening, and try to respond within two days. If I'm swamped and don't manage to, feel free to ping me after that!
