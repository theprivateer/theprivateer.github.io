😵‍💫 Getting over the jetlag (and general exhaustion) of the family trip to the UK. Figuring out what my next big focus will be.

📚 Reading [Do Agile](https://thedobook.co/products/do-agile-futureproof-your-mindset-stay-grounded) by Tim Drake for the mind - not at all what I expected (in a good way), and giving me plenty to ponder on.

[Blueprint](https://www.kobo.com/au/en/ebook/blueprint-build-a-bulletproof-body-for-extreme-adventure-in-365-days) by Ross Edgley for the body - have had this one on the go for a while as I drift in and out of good health / fitness. Aiming to finish it off by the end of the month.

🎧 Recently discovered [Nils Frahm](https://www.nilsfrahm.com/) (hat-tip to [Robert Poynton](https://robertpoynton.com/) for mentioning him in the afterword of one of his books) so putting his works into heavy rotation while working.

📺 Still need to catch up on the season finale of [Constellation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19395018/) - that will round out any series I had on the go.
