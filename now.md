🛠️ Doing general maintenance and upkeep around the house, knocking off all the jobs that have been lingering and bringing our living and entertaining spaces back to their former glory.

📚 Have had the book [Blueprint](https://www.kobo.com/au/en/ebook/blueprint-build-a-bulletproof-body-for-extreme-adventure-in-365-days) by Ross Edgley on the go for a while as I drift in and out of good health / fitness. Aiming to finish it off before I pick up any more non-fiction.

🎧 Recently discovered [Nils Frahm](https://www.nilsfrahm.com/) (hat-tip to [Robert Poynton](https://robertpoynton.com/) for mentioning him in the afterword of one of his books) so putting his works into heavy rotation while working.
